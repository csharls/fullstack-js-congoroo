# exercise anecdotes
In this aplication, we do the following:
- Display a random anecdote from an array of anecdotes
- Using the useState hook to control the anecdotes and the votes each of it has
- Use the spread operator to work with the arrays
- Conditional render to show which one is the most voted anecdote
- We also created functions to find the most voted value (the highest value in the array), and the most voted index
